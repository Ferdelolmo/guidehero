GuideHero — a React + Vite + TypeScript frontend with Node tooling.

About GuideHero is a web application built with React, Vite and TypeScript with Node used for tooling and scripts. Use this README as a starting point — update details (features, env variables, deployment) to match the repository specifics.

Features

    Fast development with Vite
    Type-safe UI with TypeScript
    React for component-based UI
    Standard Node toolchain for scripts, linting, formatting and building

Tech stack

    Frontend: React + TypeScript
    Bundler / Dev server: Vite
    Runtime/tooling: Node.js (npm or yarn)
    Optional: testing framework (Jest / Vitest), ESLint, Prettier, Husky (git hooks)

Requirements

    Node.js 16+ (Node 18+ recommended)
    npm 8+ or yarn 1+/pnpm
    Git

Installation

    Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/Ferdelolmo/guidehero.git
    Change into project directory cd guidehero
    Checkout the branch you want to work on (master) git checkout master Note: The repository's default branch may be main — confirm whether you want to keep master or use main.
    Install dependencies npm install or yarn install or pnpm install

Environment

    Copy any example environment file if present: cp .env.example .env
    Common Vite env variables (prefix VITE_ for client-side exposure):
        VITE_API_BASE_URL — base URL for API requests
        VITE_SOME_FLAG — example feature flag
    Common Node env variables:
        NODE_ENV — development|production
        PORT — dev/server port (Vite default 5173)

Development Start dev server (hot reload): npm run dev or yarn dev

Open the app at http://localhost:5173 (Vite default). If your project defines a different port, use that port.

Scripts (Adjust these to match the repo package.json scripts. Example common scripts:)

    dev: starts Vite dev server npm run dev
    build: builds production assets npm run build
    preview: locally previews production build npm run preview
    lint: runs ESLint npm run lint
    lint:fix: auto-fixes lint problems npm run lint:fix
    format: runs Prettier npm run format
    test: runs unit tests (Jest / Vitest) npm test
    typecheck: runs TypeScript type checking npm run typecheck

Building & Previewing Build for production: npm run build

Preview the production build locally: npm run preview (Preview serves the built assets using vite preview or a lightweight static server.)

Docker (optional) Example Dockerfile (basic multi-stage):

    Build stage FROM node:18-alpine AS build WORKDIR /app COPY package*.json ./ RUN npm ci COPY . . RUN npm run build
    Serve stage FROM node:18-alpine WORKDIR /app COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
    Use a static server like serve or a Node server
    RUN npm install -g serve CMD ["serve", "-s", "dist", "-l", "3000"]

Testing & Linting

    Unit tests: npm test
    E2E: (if present) e.g., Cypress: npx cypress open
    Type checking: npm run typecheck
    Lint: npm run lint

Formatting

    Format code with Prettier: npm run format
    Optionally run pre-commit hooks with Husky to run lint-staged

Deployment

    Build assets (npm run build) and deploy the dist folder to static hosting:
        Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront
    If backend is used, configure environment variables and reverse proxy as appropriate
    CI: add a GitHub Actions workflow that installs deps, runs lint, tests, builds and deploys

Contributing

    Fork the repository
    Create a branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
    Commit changes: git commit -m "feat: add ..."
    Push branch: git push origin feature/your-feature
    Open a PR against master (or main, see branch note below)

Please include:

    A clear PR description
    Screenshots or recordings for UI changes
    Tests for new behavior
    Follow existing code style (TS, ESLint/Prettier configs)

Branching / Releases

    This README targets the master branch per your request. The repository default branch may be main. Confirm whether you want:
        README added to master (create master branch if not present), or
        README added to main (preferred if main is default).
    Suggested workflow:
        main (or master) — stable production code
        develop — integration branch
        feature/* — feature branches
        hotfix/* — urgent fixes
